# helloBot!

This is an absolutely basic HTTP template for a Corrade bot for Second Life. 

If you're not familiar with Corrade bots, check out https://corrade.grimore.org/

There is plenty of great documentation on that site, but what it is lacking is a simple, basic script to get people started. You know â€” a "Hello world!" script!

So, I've taken one of their templates, and stripped it down to it's barebones.

## Requirements

  * A modern browser: Chome, Opera, Firefox, Safari...
  * A webserver.
  * PHP version 5 and beyond.
    * the curl extension.

## Setup

  1. Rename "config.php.dist" to "config.php" and edit "config.php" 
      to reflect your settings in Corrade.ini
  1. Enable the Corrade permissions for your configured group:
      * group
  1. Place the all the files in a directory on your webserver.
  1. Navigate to helloBot.php in your browser and enjoy.
